# Motivation

This application was designed to help people explore new exercises and make working out simpler.

# Features

- **Exercise Cards:** Each exercise is displayed on a card which consists of information such as exercise name, targeted muscle, equipment, and video tutorial.

- **Muscle Categories:** Users will have the option to filter through certain muscle groups. The muscle groups are categorized as "Chest", "Shoulders", "Back", "Legs", and "Core".

- **Add to Workout:** Each exercise card will have a button allowing users to add that exercise to their workout. A user's workout can be viewed by clicking the "My Workout" button. Users are also able to remove exercises from their workout.

- **Generate Workout:** If a user is extra daring, they can click on the "Generate Workout" button which will randomly pick several exercises for the user to do.
